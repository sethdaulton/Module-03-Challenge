## Random Password Generator

For this challenge assignment, I was tasked with creating a random password generator. The password generator must include several prompts asking whether or not the user wants to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers. If the user does not want to use any of these parameters the password will not contain them. 

After clicking through all of the prompts the password will generate based on the user's preferences.
